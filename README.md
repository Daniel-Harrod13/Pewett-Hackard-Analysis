# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Our mission in this project was to analyze and create two tables of retirng Pewlett Hackard employees. The first table idetifies their psotions and the numbers of employees that were leaving. The second table idetifies which of the departing employees were qualified to be a particiapnt in the mentorship program.  

## Results
We can see in the first data set titled retiring_titles.csv that this particular company is losing many Senior Staff/ Senior Engineers. Assuming those postions require the most expirence and skill, this isn't suprising, although the company will need to prioritize filling those postions. Secondly, we can see that almost 1550 employees qualify for the mentorship program (mentorship_eligibility.csv). The company is losing many potential mentors, which entales that they may need to tweak or even create a system more favorable to mentoring to help keep or prevent problems wihtin their company. 

## Summary 
By utilizing sql, and pgadmin we are able to create different tables that read off each other adn present data in ways that streamline answers to very interesting and detailed questions. We started by creating different tables that specifies and collects certain data such as taking the internal databases from the company ( the csv files that cover employees salaies etc) and determine who is retiring based on that data. We then created a second table that takes the data from the retring and created a table that then reads andf reflects qualifications based on dates that determines how many of those workers could be mentors.
